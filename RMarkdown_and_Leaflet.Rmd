# Introduction

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

# The code of the map

```{r}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() 
my_map
```
