# Introduction

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. 

# The code of the map

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>%
        addMarkers(lat=5.064287, lng=-75.501979, 
             popup="Sebas' home")
my_map
```
